Now, the project is created for us. functional programming with java.
Let's get started with creating our first example.
The first problem that we would want to solve is, we would want to print a set of numbers.
So, we'll have a list of numbers, and we would want to actually print
each element in that list, one by one on a separate line.
Now, how do we do that in a traditional approach?
I've already create a new Java class. Functional01Structured, because I want to use structured approach, which is traditional approach to print a set of numbers.
ok, let's go ahead.
Let's add in a main method here, and over here I can write all the code that we would want.
We'd want to use a Structured approach, which is the traditional programming approach. Structured approach.
We'd want to print, a list of numbers.
How do we create a list of numbers?
I can say, List.of. Let's enter a sequence of numbers.
This can be random numbers.
The method does not really exist right?
Let's try and create the method right now.
The first thing that we'd need to think about is, how to loop the numbers?
That's the traditional approach, right? So, we would want to first figure out, how do you loop all the numbers.
And once you decide how to loop, you can take each of the individual numbers and print it.
Let's use the enhanced For loop. I'll say, for int number in numbers.
also you can use traditional for loop, that's the same thing.
We'd want to print them out. So, sysout, and number.
Let's run this and see what would happen.
You can see that everything is now printed out to the console.

That's the first thing that we did, when we were talking about the Structured approach.
Now, how do we solve the same thing in a functional approach?
