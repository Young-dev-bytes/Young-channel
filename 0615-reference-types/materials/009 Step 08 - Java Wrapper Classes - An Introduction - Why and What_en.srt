00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:04,420
Welcome back.

2
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:10,070
In this video, we would start discussing about wrapper classes. We will try and understand what are wrapper

3
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:15,590
classes and also we'd discuss about why do we need wrapper classes.

4
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:17,690
What are wrapper classes?

5
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:22,870
So, we know that there are a lot of primitive variable types that we have already discussed about, right.

6
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:26,020
So, boolean, byte, char, double, float,

7
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:29,890
int is the one which we used frequently, long, and short.

8
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:31,970
The thing is, in Java,

9
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:41,270
there are corresponding classes for each of these primitive types. So, these classes are called wrapper

10
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:45,900
classes, because they are like a wrapper around this value.

11
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:53,450
So, if I take int, the wrapper class is Integer. All the other ones are exactly the same names, so boolean,

12
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:57,230
Boolean except for char as well. So, char is Character.

13
00:00:57,230 --> 00:01:02,900
So, the wrapper class for char is Character, for int is Integer and all the others is just the same

14
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:06,200
name with a capital alphabet starting off.

15
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:09,540
This is how your wrapper classes are now.

16
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:14,590
The question might be, okay, if I have primitive values why do I really need a wrapper class?

17
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,790
Why do I need a wrapper class?

18
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:23,180
The thing about wrapper classes is, they offer you a lot of options, additional options.

19
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:29,120
Let's say I would want to create a boolean value from a string or I would want to create a integer value

20
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,500
from a string.

21
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:33,620
You can do that using wrapper classes.

22
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:38,210
The other things that wrapper class provides are a number of utility methods.

23
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:45,890
So, let's say, I have a float and I would want the integer value of that specific float.

24
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:48,400
I can use a intValue( ) method.

25
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:53,960
Let's say I want to convert a string which is in binary format. So, binary is 0 and 1s.

26
00:01:53,990 --> 00:02:00,670
So, let's say, I have a string in the binary format and I would want to convert it into integer representation.

27
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:07,250
There are a lot of utility methods like this which are offered by the wrapper classes. And also, wrapper

28
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:07,730
classes

29
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:12,910
allow you to store primitive values into a collection.

30
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:17,270
We will talk about collections, a little later. If you want to add anything to a collection,

31
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:25,100
it must be an object and wrapper classes provide the objects around these primitives. Don't really worry

32
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:29,450
if you are not able to understand these methods, we would discuss them in detail a little later.

33
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:34,640
The idea behind this video was to introduce you to the concept of wrapper classes and understand why

34
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,400
do we need wrapper classes.

35
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:41,600
We'll discuss about each of these wrapper classes and some of the important methods which are present

36
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:43,640
in them in the next video.

37
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:44,600
Until then, bye bye.
