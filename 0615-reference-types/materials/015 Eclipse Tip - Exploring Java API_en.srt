00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:04,700
Welcome back.

2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:10,700
In this video, let's explore how to explore different APIs using Eclipse.

3
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:16,230
So, let's say I would want to find out everything there is to find out about the List interface.

4
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:17,340
How do I do that?

5
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:24,390
You can type in Control Shift T or Command Shift T and choose the List class. Type in List and you can

6
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:28,260
choose the List class inside Java SE 9.0.1

7
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,190
So, let's make sure I'm using the right one. So,

8
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:35,190
this is the interface that I would want to choose, Java util. Over here,

9
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:41,590
once you go into a class, you can see the entire source code related to that specific class.

10
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:47,230
If you'd want to understand what it is all about, you can try and read the description which is present

11
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,730
at the top.

12
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:51,520
Also present is the list of the methods.

13
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:57,790
You can also type in Control O or Command O. Control O or command O will get you to the list of the methods

14
00:00:57,790 --> 00:00:59,230
which are present in here. So, 

15
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:04,720
you can see all the individual methods and if you want to look at a specific one, then you can say

16
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:10,300
okay, I would want to understand the sort method and you can see the syntax of it and also, you can see

17
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:12,760
the Java doc related to that.

18
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:16,330
These are long thing and you can read that it's related to a sort.

19
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:18,450
So, this is one of the ways,

20
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:24,250
right. So, if you'd want to directly type in something, you can directly type in Java.util.list 

21
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:32,780
and go there. The other way is, let's say, I'd want to say List list = new ArrayList( ), right. So,

22
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:39,020
let's say, this is the code I am using and I press Control 1 or Command 1 to import the Arraylist

23
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:43,670
and Control 1 or Command 1 to import the List as well.

24
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:50,990
Once you do this, you can do a Control or Command and Click. So, Control or Command and Click. So, press

25
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:54,020
Control and Click or press Command and Click.

26
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:56,230
It would also take you to the same place.

27
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:02,880
Now I can look at all the documentation behind the ArrayList class as well. So,

28
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:06,860
this is the way you can explore API in Eclipse.

29
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:13,100
You can also look at the methods which are present by pressing Control O or Command O. If you want to understand

30
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:17,900
the type hierarchy of list, what are the implementation of the list, all that you need to do is say, right

31
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:24,440
click on the List and say Open Type Hierarchy. That shows the entire Type Hierarchy. So, you can see that

32
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:29,600
list interface is implemented by AbstractList, ArrayList, CopyOnWriteArrayList, and lot of other

33
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:35,300
stuff. You can see what are the different elements, methods, which are present in each of these classes

34
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:36,740
as well.

35
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:41,480
If you don't really want all the details, but you just want to have a Quick Type Hierarchy, you can say

36
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:47,810
right click and Quick Type Hierarchy and this would show the high-level overview of the type hierarchy of

37
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:53,570
that specific interface or the class. In this quick video, we wanted to give you an overview of how to

38
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:57,600
explore different APIs using Eclipse.

39
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:03,710
You can also get the same information by going to Google. All that you need to do is, go to Google and

40
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:09,710
type in the interface, list interface I would want to find out more about. So, Java list, I would want to

41
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:15,740
find the documentation related to Java 9. So, I put in jdk 9 and typed in Javadoc. Once you

42
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:22,370
go in here, you can go ahead and explore the different things related to the list interface. You can see

43
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:28,400
which module it is present, in which package it's present in. You can see all these super interfaces, sub

44
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:35,300
interfaces, all the implementing classes, and you can see the description, and also overview of the methods,

45
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:40,340
and the description of the methods which are present in here. I hope you had an interesting time in this

46
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:43,030
video. I'll see you in the next one. Until then, bye bye.
