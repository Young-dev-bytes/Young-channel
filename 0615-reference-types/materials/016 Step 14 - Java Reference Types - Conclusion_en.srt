00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:03,690
Welcome back.

2
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:09,210
In this section on reference types, we looked at what is the difference between a reference variable

3
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:11,130
and a primitive variable.

4
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:12,800
We looked at the different primitive types.

5
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:18,270
We looked at a few reference variables, how they are stored in memory, how they are initialized, and how

6
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:21,030
does assignment and equality work with them.

7
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:25,080
We also discussed a few reference types which are built-in in Java.

8
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,110
We talked in depth about the String class.

9
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:31,620
We discussed a couple of alternatives for it: StringBuilder and StringBuffer.

10
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:37,200
We also looked at a wide variety of puzzles which are related to String and we also discussed about

11
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:38,850
wrapper classes.

12
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:44,280
We discussed about the eight wrapper classes which are present in Java, which are exactly corresponding to

13
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,500
the eight primitive types.

14
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:51,660
We discussed why we need wrapper classes and also  a variety of methods which are present in the wrapper

15
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:52,770
classes as well.

16
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:59,340
And, at the end of this section, we looked at LocalDate, LocalDateTime, and LocalTime APIs. We looked

17
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:04,910
at different methods to get specific data from the date, to get generic data like leap year, or length of

18
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:10,590
the month, or length the year, and also we looked at different methods to compare with other dates as well

19
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:15,170
as to add a specific number of days, months, or years to a specific date.

20
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:23,610
This was one of the first sections where we tried to explore some of the inbuilt APIs in Java. Exploring

21
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:29,580
APIs can get a little boring at times, but it's very important to understand what you can do and what

22
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:30,740
you cannot do

23
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:36,600
and once you know what you can do, you can easily explore and try to find the right method to do that

24
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,890
specific thing.

25
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:40,610
I hope you had a interesting time in this section.

26
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:42,590
I'll see you in the next section.

27
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:43,200
Until then,

28
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:43,500
bye bye.
