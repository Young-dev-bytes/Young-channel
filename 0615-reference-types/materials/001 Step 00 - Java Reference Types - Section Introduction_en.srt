00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:01,440
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:09,360
In this section on reference types, we would discuss about what are reference types, how are they stored

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:16,470
in memory, and how are they different from primitive types. In the previous sections,

4
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:22,320
we created a number of classes and this is how we create instances, right.

5
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,360
We used a new jupiter

6
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:34,080
here is a reference variable, Planet here is a reference type, and over here when we created a int variable,

7
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:40,820
i is a primitive variable and int is a primitive type.

8
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:46,590
We will discuss about all of these concepts and we will go one level deeper.

9
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:52,380
We will talk about how the reference variables and primitive variables are stored in memory,

10
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:58,380
what happens behind these screens when you assign a value to a primitive variable or you try to assign

11
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:00,240
one value to another.

12
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:03,380
We will also talk about how they are initialized.

13
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:06,930
We will also look at a few reference types in Java.

14
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:10,200
These are predefined in the sense that Java provides them for you.

15
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:12,540
So, they come free for you with Java.

16
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:13,890
These are string.

17
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:19,170
There are a set of classes called wrapper classes and also we will look at a few date time stuff.

18
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:21,750
So, we'll look at LocalDate and LocalDateTime.

19
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:28,370
I'll see you in the first video where we would start discussing more about reference types and variables.

20
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:29,350
Until then, bye-bye
