Welcome back.
欢迎回来。

2
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:09,210
In this section on reference types, we looked at what is the difference between a reference variable
在关于引用类型的这一节中，我们研究了引用变量和原始变量之间的区别

3
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:11,130
and a primitive variable.
和原始变量的区别。

4
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:12,800
We looked at the different primitive types.
我们看了不同的原始类型。

5
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:18,270
We looked at a few reference variables, how they are stored in memory, how they are initialized, and how
我们看了一些引用变量，它们是如何存储在内存中的，它们是如何被初始化的，以及如何

6
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:21,030
does assignment and equality work with them.
赋值和等价是如何进行的。

7
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:25,080
We also discussed a few reference types which are built-in in Java.
我们还讨论了一些Java中内置的引用类型。

8
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,110
We talked in depth about the String class.
我们深入地讨论了String类。

9
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:31,620
We discussed a couple of alternatives for it: StringBuilder and StringBuffer.
我们讨论了它的几个替代品。StringBuilder和StringBuffer。

10
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:37,200
We also looked at a wide variety of puzzles which are related to String and we also discussed about
我们还研究了与String有关的各种难题，并讨论了关于

11
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:38,850
wrapper classes.
封装器类。

12
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:44,280
We discussed about the eight wrapper classes which are present in Java, which are exactly corresponding to
我们讨论了Java中存在的八个封装类，它们完全对应于

13
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,500
the eight primitive types.
八个原始类型。

14
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:51,660
We discussed why we need wrapper classes and also  a variety of methods which are present in the wrapper
我们讨论了为什么我们需要封装类，以及封装类中存在的各种方法。

15
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:52,770
classes as well.
类中的各种方法。

16
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:59,340
And, at the end of this section, we looked at LocalDate, LocalDateTime, and LocalTime APIs. We looked
在这一节的最后，我们研究了LocalDate、LocalDateTime和LocalTime APIs。我们看了

17
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:04,910
at different methods to get specific data from the date, to get generic data like leap year, or length of
我们看了不同的方法，从日期中获得特定的数据，获得通用的数据，如闰年，或月的长度，或年的长度。

18
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:10,590
the month, or length the year, and also we looked at different methods to compare with other dates as well
我们还研究了不同的方法来与其他日期进行比较，以及增加特定的天数。

19
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:15,170
as to add a specific number of days, months, or years to a specific date.
我们还研究了与其他日期进行比较的不同方法，以及在一个特定的日期上增加特定的天数、月数或年数。

20
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:23,610
This was one of the first sections where we tried to explore some of the inbuilt APIs in Java. Exploring
这是我们尝试探索Java中一些内置的API的第一节。探索

21
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:29,580
APIs can get a little boring at times, but it's very important to understand what you can do and what
API有时会有点无聊，但了解你能做什么，不能做什么，是非常重要的。

22
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:30,740
you cannot do
你不能做什么

23
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:36,600
and once you know what you can do, you can easily explore and try to find the right method to do that
一旦你知道你能做什么，你就可以轻松地探索并尝试找到正确的方法来做那件

24
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,890
specific thing.
具体的事情。

25
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:40,610
I hope you had a interesting time in this section.
