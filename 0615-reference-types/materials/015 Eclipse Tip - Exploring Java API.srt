00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:04,700
Welcome back.
欢迎回来。

2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:10,700
In this video, let's explore how to explore different APIs using Eclipse.
在这个视频中，让我们来探讨一下如何使用Eclipse来探索不同的API。

3
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:16,230
So, let's say I would want to find out everything there is to find out about the List interface.
那么，假设我想找出有关 List 接口的所有信息。

4
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:17,340
How do I do that?
我怎么做呢？

5
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:24,390
You can type in Control Shift T or Command Shift T and choose the List class. Type in List and you can
你可以输入 Control Shift T 或 Command Shift T 并选择 List 类。键入List，你可以

6
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:28,260
choose the List class inside Java SE 9.0.1
选择Java SE 9.0.1中的List类。

7
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,190
So, let's make sure I'm using the right one. So,
所以，让我们确保我使用的是正确的那一个。所以。

8
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:35,190
this is the interface that I would want to choose, Java util. Over here,
这是我想选择的接口，Java util。在这里。

9
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:41,590
once you go into a class, you can see the entire source code related to that specific class.
一旦你进入一个类，你就可以看到与该特定类有关的全部源代码。

10
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:47,230
If you'd want to understand what it is all about, you can try and read the description which is present
如果你想了解它的全部内容，你可以试着读一读顶部的描述。

11
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,730
at the top.
在顶部。

12
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:51,520
Also present is the list of the methods.
此外，还有方法的列表。

13
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:57,790
You can also type in Control O or Command O. Control O or command O will get you to the list of the methods
你也可以输入Control O或Command O，Control O或Command O会让你进入方法列表。

14
00:00:57,790 --> 00:00:59,230
which are present in here. So,
这里面有哪些方法。所以。

15
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:04,720
you can see all the individual methods and if you want to look at a specific one, then you can say
你可以看到所有单独的方法，如果你想看一个特定的方法，那么你可以说

16
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:10,300
okay, I would want to understand the sort method and you can see the syntax of it and also, you can see
好的，我想了解排序方法，你可以看到它的语法，还可以看到

17
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:12,760
the Java doc related to that.
与此相关的Java文档。

18
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:16,330
These are long thing and you can read that it's related to a sort.
这些都是很长的东西，你可以读到它与一个排序有关。

19
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:18,450
So, this is one of the ways,
所以，这也是其中一种方法。

20
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:24,250
right. So, if you'd want to directly type in something, you can directly type in Java.util.list
对。所以，如果你想直接键入一些东西，你可以直接键入Java.util.list

21
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:32,780
and go there. The other way is, let's say, I'd want to say List list = new ArrayList( ), right. So,
然后去那里。另一种方法是，比方说，我想说List list = new ArrayList( ) ，对。所以。

22
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:39,020
let's say, this is the code I am using and I press Control 1 or Command 1 to import the Arraylist
比方说，这是我正在使用的代码，我按下Control 1或Command 1来导入Arraylist

23
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:43,670
and Control 1 or Command 1 to import the List as well.
和Control 1或Command 1来导入List。

24
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:50,990
Once you do this, you can do a Control or Command and Click. So, Control or Command and Click. So, press
一旦你这样做了，你就可以做一个Control或Command and Click。所以，控制或命令和点击。所以，按

25
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:54,020
Control and Click or press Command and Click.
Control and Click或按Command and Click。

26
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:56,230
It would also take you to the same place.
它也会把你带到同一个地方。

27
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:02,880
Now I can look at all the documentation behind the ArrayList class as well. So,
现在我也可以看看ArrayList类背后的所有文档了。所以。

28
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:06,860
this is the way you can explore API in Eclipse.
这是你在Eclipse中探索API的方法。

29
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:13,100
You can also look at the methods which are present by pressing Control O or Command O. If you want to understand
你也可以通过按 Control O 或 Command O 来查看其中的方法。

30
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:17,900
the type hierarchy of list, what are the implementation of the list, all that you need to do is say, right
列表的类型层次，列表的实现是什么，你所需要做的就是，在列表上点击右键

31
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:24,440
click on the List and say Open Type Hierarchy. That shows the entire Type Hierarchy. So, you can see that
点击列表，然后说 "打开类型层次结构"。这就显示了整个类型层次结构。所以，你可以看到

32
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:29,600
list interface is implemented by AbstractList, ArrayList, CopyOnWriteArrayList, and lot of other
list接口是由AbstractList、ArrayList、CopyOnWriteArrayList和很多其他的东西实现的。

33
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:35,300
stuff. You can see what are the different elements, methods, which are present in each of these classes
的东西。你可以看到这些类中有哪些不同的元素和方法。

34
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:36,740
as well.
也是如此。

35
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:41,480
If you don't really want all the details, but you just want to have a Quick Type Hierarchy, you can say
如果你不是真的想要所有的细节，而只是想拥有一个快速类型层次，你可以说

36
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:47,810
right click and Quick Type Hierarchy and this would show the high-level overview of the type hierarchy of
你可以说，右键点击快速类型层次，这将显示该特定接口或类的类型层次的高级概述。

37
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:53,570
that specific interface or the class. In this quick video, we wanted to give you an overview of how to
该特定接口或类的类型层次。在这个快速视频中，我们想让你了解一下如何使用Eclipse探索不同的API。

38
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:57,600
explore different APIs using Eclipse.
使用Eclipse探索不同的API。

39
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:03,710
You can also get the same information by going to Google. All that you need to do is, go to Google and
你也可以通过去谷歌获得同样的信息。你所需要做的就是，到Google上并

40
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:09,710
type in the interface, list interface I would want to find out more about. So, Java list, I would want to
键入接口，列出我想了解的接口。所以，Java列表，我想

41
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:15,740
find the documentation related to Java 9. So, I put in jdk 9 and typed in Javadoc. Once you
所以，我输入jdk 9，然后输入Javadoc。一旦你

42
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:22,370
go in here, you can go ahead and explore the different things related to the list interface. You can see
进入这里，你就可以继续探索与列表接口有关的不同东西。你可以看到

43
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:28,400
which module it is present, in which package it's present in. You can see all these super interfaces, sub
它存在于哪个模块中，它存在于哪个包中。你可以看到所有这些超级接口、子

44
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:35,300
interfaces, all the implementing classes, and you can see the description, and also overview of the methods,
接口，所有的实现类，你还可以看到描述，以及方法的概述。

45
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:40,340
and the description of the methods which are present in here. I hope you had an interesting time in this
以及这里存在的方法的描述。我希望你在这个

46
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:43,030
video. I'll see you in the next one. Until then, bye bye.
